# FIN THE BABY SHARKO
Your finest search site for images 

## Who is FIN?
FIN is a young shark that has been programmed to find the photos that best fit your search. 

## How FIN was developed?
 The main goal of this project was to try the concept of informing people where all of their photos were saved. So they can be aware of and in control of their data, this is the idea the fin was born.
 Later due to limited resources and time constraint it was barely a search website
 
## Concepts behind
#### **->**  Flask
#### **->** Sqlite3
#### **->** A couple of Thirdparty APIs 

## How to use?
A common end user with no prior computer experience can utilise FIN to its complete capability. 
Try typing your image query in the form of a file, link, or phrase. 

## Ideas to improve
#### **->**  synchronise a NoSQL database 
#### **->**  Implementing own search stategies
#### **->**  Having Gunicorn Server for better Scalability
#### **->**  Improving test cases, round corners and modularity
#### **->**  Having Javascript libraries as frontend
